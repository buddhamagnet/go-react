### GO-REACT

A simple React app with a Go back end I put together after being interrupted by
my kids during a coding test.

### HOW TO RUN

- Clone repo.
- Go into `client` folder.
- Run `yarn install`.
- Run `yarn run:server && yarn run:client`.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Profit.
- Let me know if you want me to add a GraphQL server.
